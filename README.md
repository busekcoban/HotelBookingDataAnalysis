# Hotel Booking Data Analysis - Streamlit Application

This project features a Streamlit application developed to thoroughly analyze hotel bookings between 2015 and 2017.

The project offers an interactive web application for users to dynamically filter and visualize hotel data.
It presents graphs showing important data points such as the distribution of reservations by month, cancellation status, guest distribution by country, average daily rate based on family size and distribution of weekend and week night stays.

- Select hotel, year, country and customer type using the filters on the left side.
- Update the main dashboard of the project with the selected filters and view the total reservation count.
- Explore the data in more detail through the graphs.
  
This application serves as an example of data analysis and visualization applications using Streamlit and Python.
